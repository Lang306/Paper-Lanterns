# Paper-Lanterns

Take a quiet moment for yourself.
Think of one question or concern that’s been on your mind lately—the one that truly matters to you right now.

Before you begin, take a slow, deep breath. Let it ground you.

Now, open the book somewhere—anywhere—without overthinking.

Read the first sentence you see. Then pause.
Let it sit with you. Ask yourself: How might this relate to what’s on your heart?

You don’t need to understand it right away.
Just allow the words to linger, like a whisper you weren’t expecting.

This book won’t give you answers.
But it might offer a small spark—a new perspective, a quiet nudge.

Trust the process.
And more than anything, trust yourself.
